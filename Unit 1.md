noun 1 は noun 2 です

> グレイさんは　べんごしです。 "Mr Grey is an attorney."

* The particle は - the topic marker  
は ("as for...") follows noun 1, singling it out as the "topic" of the sentence. Noun 2 is then identified, and the phrase is concluded with です. The topic is the person or thing that the sentence is about. The topic is often the same as the subject but not necessarily.

noun 1 は noun 2 ですか  
はい、 (noun 1 は) noun 2 です  
いいえ、 (noun 1 は) noun 2 ではありません／じゃありません

* The particle か -　the question marker  
It is easy to make questions in Japanese. Simply place the particle か at the end of the sentence. No change in word order is required even when the question contains interrogatives like "who," "what," "when," etc.  
**NOTE:** Intonation normally rises on　か, i.e., ...ですか.

* はい／いいえ
はい is virtually the same as "yes", and いいえ is virtually the same as "no."

* Ommison of the topic (noun 1)  
  When it is obvious to the other person what the topic is, it is generally omitted.
  > (わたしは）　グレイです。 "(As for me) I'm Grey."

  But when it is necessary to make clear what the topic is, it is not omitted.
  > (こちらは）　グレイさんです。 "This is Mr. Grey."

  Often the topic is omitted in answers to questions.
  > グレイさんは　べんごしですか。 "Is Mr. Grey an attorney?"  
  > い、　べんごしです。 "Yes, (he) is an attorney."  
  > いいえ、　べんごしでは　ありまえせん。 "No, (he) isn't an attorney."

* ではありません／じゃありません  
ではありません or じゃありません is the negative for of です. じゃ is more informal than では; otherwise they are the same. The chart below summarizes the forms of です。

| Present form |                | Past form |                      |
